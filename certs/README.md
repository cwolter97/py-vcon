# THESE CERTS ARE FOR TESTING ONLY!!!!
As the private keys for these certs and public keys are published here, they ARE NOT SECURE OR SAFE TO USE IN ANY DEPLOYMENT!

There is a [Makefile](Makefile) here which was used to contruct the certs.  This may be useful in learning out to make secure, real certs for use in a production environment as long as you protect your private keys.
